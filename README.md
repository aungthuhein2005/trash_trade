# Trash Detection using CNN

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify different types of waste, such as plastic, tin, glass, and others. The model is trained using the TrashNet dataset, a collection of images representing various types of trash.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build an effective CNN model that can classify waste into different categories. This classification can help improve recycling processes and reduce waste pollution.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [TrashNet dataset](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/trashnet), which contains images of different types of waste organized into various categories:
- Plastic
- Tin
- Glass
- Cardboard
- Other

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trash-detection.git
